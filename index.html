                I'm fascianed by space. Since I was a kid, I loved learing about planets, galaxies and stars. And I still do. I can spend hours watching footage from Mars Explorers, Saturn and Jupiters PROBES or Hubble Telescope. Watching actual movies recorded on Moon by men - for me, it's awesome. The next 5 years will really great, as in 2016 James Webb Telescope will be lunched and in 2021 The Great Magellan Telescope will be finished. They will bring us so much inforamtion about who we are, and where did we came from. On top of that, one of my favorite games is Kerbal Space Program. I'm also having a constant inner fight about buying 10" Dobsonian telescope (ah, the famous british weather...).

                  My first contact with hard cinema was "The Idiots" by Lars Von Trier, when I was around 14. A movie way above my age at that time. But it opened my eyes, that cinema can be hard are challenging. I’ve stareted watching movies from Von Trier, Bergman, Lynch, Kieslowski, Polanski, Aronfsky, Boyle to name just a few. As every movie lover I don't have favorite movie. But if I had a gun sticked to my head I would choose "Casblanca"... No, "12 Angry Man" or "Fucking Amal" or "Interstellar", or "Decalog" or "Breaking the Waves" or "God Father"... I would probably end up dead.

                <h1>Science-Ficition</h1>
                <p>
                  In every shape or form - as long as it's good. My favourite books are Dune, Rendezvous with Rama, Foundation and Ender’s Saga. Because of my love to movies, I really value good science fiction movie. Unfortunately most of western science fiction is action based with few amazing exceptions like “Contact”, “The Interstellar” or “Man from Earth”.There is also anime - japanese animated series, which some are as deep as Game of Thrones. Because it’s animated, it’s let’s picture even the most crazy ideas, way before super complicated CG.<br>    
                  What I really love in science fiction is that it lets you explore other worlds. When you start reading a book that describes a world, that you’ve never heard of you feel lost - but the more you read, the more you understand what rules given world.<br>    
                  We are surrounded by things, that just 20 years ago were pure science fiction. So it’s really possible, that what we read today, will be the future. This sums my love for science fiction - it’s a sneak peak to the future.

                    Creating real world objects is really exciting. While programing is amazing - you cannot touch you program. That’s why I started learning electronics. Last year I got my first Arduino, and all the dots started to connect. I still make stupid mistakes, and sometimes I impress myself with lack of basic knowledge. But it's still amazing. You can program real world. My biggest success until now, are remote power sockets. I read radio data from cheap remote controlled sockets to raspberry, and build simple interface with python to be to turn on/off home appliances. I have couple of ideas stacked up as well. In the future I want to build intelligent mirror, home alarm system, and cyber-plant.

                <p>
                  So much fun! If you think board games end on Monopoly and Risk you are so wrong. There are thousands of amazing titles, some easy to understand and relaxing, others complex with a lot of bluffing and strategy. Current favourites are Carcassone, Splendor and Pandemic. I really enjoy cooperative games where every bad decision reflects whole group - you really need to brainstorm every decision.<br> 
                  You can meet me on almost every Tuesday in “Bull’s Eye” pub in Warrington, where local board gaming community meet and play.

I’ve used frameworks such as <span class='bold'>CodeIgniter</span>, <span class='bold'>Kohana</span>, <span class='bold'>Laravel</span> or <span class='bold'>Flight</span>. I wrote tens of different apps. From simple forums, to complicated resource managers. You can find some of my apps on this website, all login details are in description of the app. Some of the features had to be turned off due the security reasons, and all databases are defaulting every hour.

                        CMS built on <span class='bold'>CodeIgniter</span>  framework and written with one goal - be <span class='bold'>as easy as possible</span> . Most of our users <span class='bold'>are not tech savy</span> , and find it hard learning complicated CMS systems. My idea was to <span class='bold'>“Edit the page”</span> . Using <span class='bold'>CkEditor</span>  option to edit divs, I’ve created a system that lets you edit your page live.
                        When you edit your page you can see exactly how it looks for visitors. Beside normal text page you can add: <span class='bold'>Guest book</span> , <span class='bold'>Gallery(with picture rotation)</span> , <span class='bold'>Booking system</span> , <span class='bold'>Testimonials</span> , <span class='bold'>Price estimation system</span> .
                        It’s been deployed to over <span class='bold'>1200 users</span>  with a very good response. Below you can find details that will let you login to three different backends: <span class='bold'>Customer Panel</span> , <span class='bold'>Admin Panel</span> , <span class='bold'>SEO Panel</span> .
